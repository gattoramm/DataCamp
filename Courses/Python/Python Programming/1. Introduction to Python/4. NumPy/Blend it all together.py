"""
Convert heights and positions, which are regular lists, to numpy arrays. Call them np_heights and np_positions.
Extract all the heights of the goalkeepers. You can use a little trick here: use np_positions == 'GK' as an index for np_heights. Assign the result to gk_heights.
Extract all the heights of all the other players. This time use np_positions != 'GK' as an index for np_heights. Assign the result to other_heights.
Print out the median height of the goalkeepers using np.median(). Replace None with the correct code.
Do the same for the other players. Print out their median height. Replace None with the correct code.
