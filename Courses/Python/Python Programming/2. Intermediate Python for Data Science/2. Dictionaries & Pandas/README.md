## Dictionaries & Pandas
Learn about the dictionary, an alternative to the Python list, and the Pandas DataFrame, the de facto standard to work with tabular data in Python. You will get hands-on practice with creating, manipulating and accessing the information you need from these data structures.

### Motivation for dictionaries
To see why dictionaries are useful, have a look at the two lists defined on the right. `countries` contains the names of some European countries. `capitals` lists the corresponding names of their capital.

### Create dictionary
The `countries` and `capitals` lists are again available in the script. It's your job to convert this data to a dictionary where the country names are the keys and the capitals are the corresponding values. As a refresher, here is a recipe for creating a dictionary:

```python
my_dict = {
   "key1":"value1",
   "key2":"value2",
}
```

In this recipe, both the keys and the values are strings. This will also be the case for this exercise.
