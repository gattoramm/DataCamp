## SELECTion Box
Hit the ground running by learning the basics of SELECT statements to retrieve data from one or more columns. You'll also learn how to apply filters to both numeric and text data, and sort the results.

### Simple selections
It's time to begin writing your own queries! In this first coding exercise, you will use `SELECT` statements to retrieve columns from a database table. You'll be working with the `eurovision` table, which contains data relating to individual country performance at the [Eurovision Song Contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest) from 1998 to 2012.

After selecting columns, you'll also practice renaming columns, and limiting the number of rows returned.

### More selections
Now that you've practiced how to select one column at a time, it's time to practice selecting more than one column. You'll continue working with the `eurovision` table.
